What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	Git stores all its metadata for the project files. It is needed in order
	to use git.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	In the staging area we will put the files for the next commit. It is a middle step
	before the commit, but it also offers ore control in what files we will commit.
